# Homebanking

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.7 and the goal of it was to create a system of a Home Banking.

## Project Description

The application has a system to create account and login using session storage. Then see the username, email and balance in the home page, then in the balance page you can add or take away money from the account and in the movement page u can see a table of those movements. All that data can be seen in the folder server or at `http://localhost:3000/movimentos` and `http://localhost:3000/users`.


## Running project

You can run the app by in the terminal type `ng serve --open` and in the `/server` folder type `json-server db.json`


## Issues

One requirement was to use the [Framework Hapi](https://hapi.dev/) but I had some issues to replace the routes because I was only getting the HTML content so I used Angular routes [Common Routing Tasks](https://angular.io/guide/router) instead, and after I wanted to use [JSON Web Token](https://hapi.dev/module/jwt/) but since I had those issues I couldn't do it.

## Thoughts

I'm happy with what I did, I would like to have finished everything perfectly but since I had to work for my father a few times I didn't had a lot of time to finish it as I wanted, but I think when u look at the code u can see someone who reads the Docs and a person who tried and tried, meaning that's my best skill, I try until I figure out things. I hope that's enough for now to go to the next phase, so for now thank you for the opportunity an I'll wait for the response.
